Wine is the most commonly used beverage globally, and its values are considered important in society. Wine is an alcoholic drink that is made up of fermented grapes. Quality of wine is important for its consumers, mainly for producers in the present competitive market to raise the revenue.  Wine quality refers to the factors that go into producing a wine, as well as the indicators or characteristics that tell you if the wine is of high quality. Historically, wine quality used to be determined by testing at the end of the production. 


If you have come across wine then you will notice that wine has also their type, they are red and white wine. According to experts, wine is differentiated according to its smell, flavour, and colour, but we are not wine experts to say that wine is good or bad. Every person has their own opinion about the tastes, so identifying a quality based on a personâ€™s taste is challenging. Judging the quality of wine manually is a really tough task, even the professional wine tasters have the accuracy of 71%.


In this project, we present a wine quality prediction technique that utilizes historical data to train simple machine learning models which are more accurate and can help us know the quality of wine. The models can be run on much less resource intensive environments. From this the best model is selected and saved in pkl format. We will be doing flask integration and IBM deployment.

Note:-

To work with the WineQuality.ipynb file, you can install Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

To download all the required Python libraries, use the following command format:- pip install <Library_Name> For example, to install Flask, use:- pip install flask Make sure to replace <Library_Name> with the name of the library you need to install.

Adjust the paths based on your system's directories. For example:- D:/Project/Training/WineQuality_New.pkl in Flask_App/app.py (as referenced in the code), and set the dataset path accordingly in WineQuality.ipynb (also referenced in the code). For instance:- D:/Project/Dataset/WineQualityN.csv, as mentioned in both Flask_App/app.py and the WineQuality.ipynb file and don't change the project files structure.
